# text_based_rpg

This is an unfinished project that is put on hold. A previously working version may exist somewhere in the commits, but the idea was to expand on the code and make it more suffisticated, using classes and dictionaries. Fortunately, university and other personal projects got in the way and put this on hold. I might revisit it in the near future, but current plans are focussed on education, work, and other endeavours.
